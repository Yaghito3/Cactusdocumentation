# Placeholders

Placeholders are dynamic variables that can be used within **Cactus Mod** to display real-time information.  
They are formatted as `{category.name}` and are automatically replaced with the corresponding value by the `PlaceholderHandler`.

## How it works

The `PlaceholderHandler` manages two types of values:

### 📥 Static Placeholders
These are hardcoded in the client (as seen in the list above).  
They are updated every frame or whenever the value is requested.  
If a value cannot be resolved (e.g. you are not in a world), a **fallback** value (like `0` or `Unknown`) is displayed.

### 🔄 Dynamic Placeholders
These can be registered by addons or received from external sources.  
They use an `Identifier` and can be bound to a specific **Required State** to ensure they only appear when relevant.

> **Tip:** You can use these placeholders in most text-based modules, such as the Custom HUD or Macros!
